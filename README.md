## What this App Does

This microservice app looks up the city of the user and it returns a JSON object of the user's location. I wrote code to display the City, State, and Zipcode on the screen for testing purposes. 

This app will be on different port than The Directory so that it can be running 99.99% of the time, listening for request from users. 

## Which files to use?

The code for the zip code lookup will be in the file: searchZipCode.js
